Spectral2D
==========

A 2D pseudo-spectral code to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in
vorticity-streamfunction formulation.

Required Software and Environment Variables
===========================================
- You must have the MPI and Fortran-enabled version of FFTW installed (v3.3.3
  was used when writing this code).
- You must have the environment variable FFTW_ROOT set to the root directory of
  the FFTW installation. For example, if your FFTW libraries and header files
  are installed in /usr/lib and /usr/include, set FFTW_ROOT to /usr. In bash,
  placing "export FFTW_ROOT=/usr" in your .bashrc will work.
- You must have the parallel and Fortran-enabled HDF5 library installed (v1.8.14
  was used when writing this code).
- You must have the environment variable HDF5_ROOT set to the root directory of
  the HDF5 installation.
- Export the HDF5 library directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
  In bash: "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HDF5_ROOT}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" will work.
- After installing HDF5 with cmake, you must place the FindHDF5.cmake file in
  the cmake/modules/FindHDF5.cmake, which is in the root project directory.

Simulation Options
==================

Right now an input file to the code is not available. The user-defined inputs
are clearly marked with explanations in Spectral2D.F90, and can be adjusted to
run different simulations.

Installation
============
1. Change to the main source directory:
    $ cd /path/to/Spectral2D
2. Make a build directory and go into it:
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
3. Enter the cmake curses GUI and press c to configure cmake:
    $ ccmake ..
    $ [in cmake curses GUI] c
4. Enter the installation prefix (note: this can run from build if you wish):
    $ [in cmake curses GUI] CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/installation
5. Configure your changes in cmake:
    $ [in cmake curses GUI] c
6. Generate the Makefile and exit the cmake curses GUI.
    $ [in cmake curses GUI] g
7. Make the program.
    $ make
8. Install the program.
    $ make install
